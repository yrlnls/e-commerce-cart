# Simple E-Commerce Cart
_By Otuoma Tillen_
A simple e-commerce cart application built with **React** and **Vite**. This app allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, adjust quantities, and view the total price. The cart state is persisted using `localStorage`, so it remains intact even after refreshing the page.
